	<p class="centerp"> Wolf Fang D&D was created in 2022 after Chance, the current club president, was inspired by the many different kinds of clubs UWG offered. He shared his idea for a D&D club with his friends and together, they formed Wolf Fang D&D! The first year saw only 10 members, but the club's popularity has steadily grown and currently has 50 members.</p>
