	<p class="centerp">In the world of Ecrea, year 3030, the capital, Favor City, was once renowned for its trade and economic power, however it is now drowned in crime and twisted plots to get to the top. The head of Syndicate Pharmaceuticals, Jay Syndicate, is suspected of poisoning his Cyber enhancements. His daughter Sarah is the head of the Underground, an organization for those who don't have anywhere else to go. Most people in the Underground seek revenge for the pain Jay has caused them. Our adventurers navigate the crime-ridden city and try their best to get to the bottom of Jay Syndicate's schemes. </p>
